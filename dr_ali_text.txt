#Breast Implant Surgery Procedure

### How do I prepare for breast implant surgery?  
Dr. Ali’s office will give you specific instructions leading up to your breast implant surgery. You may have to stop or start taking certain medications before surgery, so inform Dr. Ali of all medications and supplements you are taking during your consultation.  
You must stop taking anti-inflammatory medications (including Ibuprofen, Motrin, Aspirin and Aleve) seven days before surgery. You must also avoid supplements that thin the blood for at least a week prior to your surgery. This includes: fish oil, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E in doses higher than 400IU per day, turmeric and ginger.  If you are a smoker, you must quit completely for six weeks before, and 6 weeks after, your breast implant surgery. This is because smoking is proven to delay or interfere with the body’s ability to heal.  Dr. Ali’s office will give you instructions about what to do the night before breast implant surgery, including fasting. If you have any health issues or illnesses in the days leading up to your surgery, always notify Dr. Ali’s office immediately. You will need to schedule someone to wait for you during the surgery who can then drive you home. You will also need to arrange to have a family member or friend stay with you for the first several days after surgery, as there will restrictions on lifting, driving and other daily activities.  



### Will I be given anesthesia during breast implant surgery?  
The selection of anesthesia is a collaborative decision made between the patient, surgeon, and anesthesiologist. Factors such as the patient’s medical history, the extent of the surgery, and personal preferences play a significant role in determining the most suitable option. The goal is to provide a safe and comfortable experience for the patient. Breast implant surgery can be performed under two types of anesthesia. Typically general anesthesia is used – which puts you completely to sleep. General anesthesia renders the patient completely unconscious and unaware during the surgery. It is typically administered through an IV line or inhalation. This option is common for more complex procedures like breast implant surgery, as it ensures the patient remains completely relaxed and pain-free throughout the duration of the operation.  In some cases of less extensive surgery, "twilight anesthesia" may be used that keeps you relaxed and sleepy through an IV drip. While the patient may be semi-conscious, they are unlikely to remember the surgical procedure. 
Dr. Ali will discuss your anesthesia options with you completely during your consultation. Understanding the different types of anesthesia options is an essential aspect of preparing for breast implant surgery. Oakland County board certified plastic surgeon Dr. Ali will work closely with patients to tailor anesthesia choices based on individual needs, ensuring a positive and stress-free experience throughout the surgical journey.  



### Where are the incisions made during breast implant surgery?  
As one of Oakland County’s top breast implant surgeons, Dr. Ali is masterful at keeping incisions as small and inconspicuous as possible. Depending upon your size and shape, and the size of the implant, the small incision may be made in the breast crease, around the nipple, or in the armpit.  Gel breast implants require a slightly longer incision than saline implants, since gel implants are "prefilled" and need more room for insertion. If you are also undergoing a breast lift at the time of the implants, there will be additional incisions related to the breast lift. After examining your breasts, Dr. Ali will discuss the best incision options for your body and the implants you choose.  The incision’s location is crucial for minimizing scarring, achieving desired outcomes, and ensuring a seamless recovery. Common incision options used in breast implant surgery include:  
1. **Inframammary Breast Implant Incision:**  
Placed discreetly within the natural fold underneath the breast, the inframammary incision is a popular choice for breast augmentation. This location allows for direct access to the breast pocket, providing optimal visibility for precise implant placement. It typically results in a well-hidden scar beneath the breast crease.  

2. **Periareolar Breast Implant Incision:**  
This incision is made along the border of the areola, where the darker pigmentation helps conceal scarring. The periareolar incision provides direct access for precise implant positioning. However, it’s essential to note that this option may not be suitable for those with smaller areolas or a preference for minimizing changes in nipple sensation.  

3. **Transaxillary Breast Implant Incision:**  
Placed within the natural folds of the underarm, the transaxillary incision is an excellent choice for those desiring no scarring on the breast itself. This approach involves the use of an endoscope to guide the surgeon in creating the breast pocket and positioning the implant. While scars are hidden in the underarm, adjusting the implant may be challenging with this method.  

4. **Transumbilical Breast Implant Incision (TUBA):**  
Also known as the belly button incision, TUBA involves making an incision within the navel through which the implant is guided into position. While this technique leaves no scars on the breast, it’s typically reserved for saline implants and may have limitations in achieving optimal results for certain patients.  

5. **Trans-areolar Breast Implant Incision with Dual Plane Technique:**  
Combining the peri-areolar incision with the dual plane technique, this approach allows for both precise implant placement and adjustments to the breast tissue. The dual plane technique involves placing the implant partially beneath the chest muscle, contributing to a more natural-looking result.  

The selection of the ideal incision depends on various important factors, including personal preferences, your body type, and the size and type of implant chosen. Oakland County board certified plastic surgeon Dr. Ali has performed several hundred breast implant surgeries. He will thoroughly explain your breast implant incision options, ensuring a positive and customized breast augmentation experience.  




### How long does breast implant surgery take?  
Breast implant surgery can be done safely as an outpatient procedure. Generally, the breast implant surgery itself takes no longer than 2 hours to complete. If a breast lift is also being performed at the same time, an additional hour or hour and a half is required.  You will need some additional time to wake up from the anesthesia. But most patients are able to go home the same day.  




### What kind of dressings will I have after the breast implant surgery?  
Typically you will be sent home with tape or adhesive strips directly on your incision, with gauze over the adhesive, and possibly an ace bandage for compression. You will receive instructions for your post-surgery care, and dates for your follow-up appointments from Dr. Ali’s office.  Only rarely in breast implant surgery is a "drain" tube used. However if a breast lift is performed at the same time, one drain in each breast may sometimes be required.  
Generally you can remove the gauze dressings the day after surgery. But tape or adhesive strips that are directly on the incision, should NOT be removed. Only let the Dr. remove them, or let them fall off naturally. If any drains are used, they generally must stay in until the drainage is less than 25 ml per drain in a twenty four hour period.  Dr. Ali will will send you home with detailed instructions for your after-care. And our office will schedule follow up appointments for removal of the adhesives, as well as the drains if they are used.



# Breast Implant FAQs

### Who can get breast implants?  
Virtually any woman in reasonably good health is a candidate for breast implant surgery. Women who are thin, normal body weight or even slightly overweight typically qualify for breast implant surgery.  Since hormonal changes in a teenager's growing body can affect breast size, a woman must be over the age of 18 to have breast implant surgery. Silicone breast implants are only FDA-approved for augmentation in women age 22 or older. Women who are substantially overweight are not ideal breast implant candidates. And women who are smokers must stop smoking completely for 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after breast implant surgery.  Breast implant surgery can be performed to increase the size of breasts that a woman feels are too small. It can also be done to balance the size of two unequal or asymmetrical breasts. Breast implant surgery can also fill in breast volume that was lost after pregnancy or nursing. And, of course, breast implants are frequently used during breast reconstruction after breast surgery.  If a women has breasts that are very "droopy" – a condition called ptosis – a breast lift is typically also performed, along with the breast implant procedure. This ensures that the implants are positioned at the correct height.  


### What are breast implants made of?  
There are currently many different types of FDA approved breast implants. All breast implants consist of a silicone outer shell – which is filled with either silicone gel (gummy implants) or a salt-water solution (saline implants). They come in different sizes, shapes (round or teardrop), "profiles" (projection from chest) and dimensions.  Dr. Ali has decades of experience helping thousands of women choose the best breast implant for their, size, frame, shape, body-type and lifestyle. He will discuss the advantages of each type of breast implant with you at your initial consultation. 


### How do I know what my breast implants will look like?  
Dr. Ali is among the first and only plastic surgeons in Oakland County and all of Michigan to offer state-of-the-art Vectra 3D imaging for breast implant patients. This revolutionary imaging system provides a three-dimensional computerized image of the patient's breasts from any and every angle – so that Dr. Ali can show you your options and the expected results before your breast implant surgery. The Vectra 3D system enables Dr. Ali to digitally superimpose an image of different breast implants over your actual pre-op body – in addition to comparing the "before and after" views side-by-side. By visualizing your potential breast implant outcomes in live 3D you and Dr. Ali know in advance what to expect – so that together you can decide on the best possible size, shape and position of your new breast implants. If you are considering breast implants, you no longer have to leave your results to chance or speculation. With Vectra 3D imaging you will see what your results will be in advance – with no surprises or misunderstandings! Choose skilled board certified plastic surgeon Dr. Ali, and see your breast implant results before your procedure(s) with Vectra's innovative and advanced 3D computerized imaging.  



### Does insurance cover breast implants?  
Insurance will typically cover breast implants if they are used for reconstruction after a mastectomy, or to match a reconstructed breast on the other side. But if your breast implants are purely for cosmetic reasons, most insurance companies will not cover the cost of this procedure.However, Dr. Ali's office participates with two very good providers of financing options. So you may be able to obtain financing, and pay for the breast implant procedure over time. Our office staff will be happy to provide you with the financing information at your first consultation.  



### Is breast implant surgery painful?  
The pain associated with breast implant surgery varies from patient to patient – and procedure to procedure. The size and placement of the breast implant will affect the size and location of the incision, which in turn will affect pain during recovery. Additionally, every person has a different pain tolerance. And each patient's surgery will be performed slightly differently, in order to customize the breast implants to match their body. Dr. Ali is a skilled plastic surgeon who will do everything possible to minimize your pain, including making the smallest incisions possible, and prescribing the most effective pain medication. Typically, by or before the end of the first week you will only need Tylenol or Motrin to control any pain. Pain after any surgery, including breast implants, is always worse in the first few days after surgery. But the pain after breast implant surgery tends to rapidly improve. If you have had other surgery before, this can be an indication of how you will feel after breast implant surgery.  Dr. Ali's thousands of satisfied breast implant patients universally agree that any short-term pain or discomfort was well worth it, to have the breasts that they have always dreamed of having.
